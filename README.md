## panaudio [IN BETA]
panaudio is a music streaming apps currently compatiable with Jellyfin. It is currently in development and not currently for general use, however, you're free to build it and try if you wish!

## Info
Bugs: There will be bugs. Report any you find with as much info as you can provide and i'll fix as soon as possible!

Android Auto: This works for me, however, due to Google shenanigans you have to enable developer options for Android auto.
